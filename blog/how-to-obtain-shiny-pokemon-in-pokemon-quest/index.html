<h3>What exactly is a Shiny Pok√©mon?</h3>
<p>A Shiny Pok√©mon is a rare variant of a Pok√©mon, that has a different colour variation of its normal form. The variation in colour can be substantial for some Pok√©mon, whereas others will have less notable differences. For example Caterpie has a major difference in its colour when it's Shiny, whereas Gengar has a very subtle colour difference as you can see below:</p>
<p><img src="/images/uploads/gengar-caterpie.jpeg" alt="Shiny difference of Caterpie and Gengar" title="Shiny Pokemon Comparison"></p>
<p>In other Pok√©mon games when a Shiny Pok√©mon is encountered, as I've mentioned before, a set of stars appears around the Pok√©mon and in later games, a set of squares can also shown around a Shiny Pok√©mon. However, this is not the case in Pok√©mon Quest as it can only be visually distinguished with its change in colour.</p>
<p>Once you obtain a Shiny Pok√©mon, if at anytime it were to evolve, it will keep its Shiny status across evolutions. However, the colouring for its shiny evolution might be different to that of previous evolutions, so if you like a particular colour palette of a Shiny Pok√©mon, make sure that when you evolve them that you're going to be happy with that evolution's colour variation, otherwise you might be stuck with a Shiny Pok√©mon you don't like.</p>
<h3>How do I get a Shiny Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Quest?</h3>
<p>Obtaining Shiny Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Quest is very simple, anytime you cook a dish to attract a Pok√©mon to your base camp, or when you take in your daily visitor Pok√©mon, there will be a slight chance that they will be Shiny. The exact probability/chance of receiving a Shiny Pok√©mon seems to be unknown from the handful of articles, subreddit posts and Discord conversations. The consensus is that it's much easier than the 1 in 4096 in most mainline games, and some articles floated around the chances of being around the 1 in 75 and 1 in 100 range, which seems to be likely from my experience of Shiny hunting in this game.</p>
<p>Just a word of warning, make sure you stay vigilant when you obtain new Pok√©mon, as I made the mistake of using up a Shiny Abra on an Alakazam I was training, only to find out a few weeks later, due to seeing the star icon next to Abra's entry in the Pok√©dex, that I messed up. So if you're unsure that a Pok√©mon you've obtained is Shiny, check the Pok√©dex for the star icon, and by tapping the Pok√©mon's model preview which will switch it to the Pok√©mon's Shiny variant.</p>
<p><img src="/images/uploads/abra-shiny-comparison.jpeg" alt="Abra Pok√©dex Shiny Comparison" title="Abra Pok√©dex Entry"></p>
<p>There is one method people use to Shiny hunt efficiently, which is changing your clock time, to trick the game into giving you a new Pok√©mon visitor, which refreshes every 22 hours. Or you stick with the legitimate method of cooking dishes.</p>
<p>If you want to hunt for a specific shiny Pok√©mon, you can look at the Pok√©mon recipe section of this web app <a href="https://pokequestrecipes.me/pokemon">here</a>! For some Pok√©mon like <a href="https://pokequestrecipes.me/pokemon/jynx">Jynx</a>, it can be quite rare to obtain them, plus it's even rarer to obtain them as a Shiny Pok√©mon. What might be a better strategy is Shiny hunting using the <a href="https://pokequestrecipes.me/types/mulligan-stew-a-la-cube">Mulligan Stew a la Cube</a> dish which will allow you to randomly get a Shiny from the large pool of Pok√©mon that can be found within that dish.</p>
<h3>Are Shiny Pok√©mon stronger?</h3>
<p>You would think that having a super difficult to obtain variant of a Pok√©mon would mean they would be significantly stronger. Unfortunately this is not the case in any Pok√©mon game, including Pok√©mon Quest. Who cares anyway? You've got a cool, badass rare variant of Pok√©mon, what more could you want?</p>
<p>Good luck in your Shiny hunting trainers!</p>
