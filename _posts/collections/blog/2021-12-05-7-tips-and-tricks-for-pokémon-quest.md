Since Pokémon Quest was released on the Nintendo Switch and Mobile platforms, a multitude of helpful information is now available to improve people’s experience with the game. I’ve compiled seven (hopefully) useful tips, which you may, or may not be aware of, that should help all of you Pokémon trainers out there, by making your experience with Pokémon Quest, that bit better.

### 1. Be tactical with the scatter button

A lot of people actually dismiss the scatter button altogether, due to the fact that Pokémon will scatter away in random directions. This may be true, but it can be useful in many situations and has saved me multiple times in boss fights at later stages of the game. One of the best uses are for Pokémon who use directional beam moves like Psybeam and Hyper Beam, as scattering might give you a better chance of dodging them, especially if your Pokémon have decided to get up close and personal.

### 2. Keep an eye on the location colour wheel for certain ingredients

Gathering ingredients is a major part of the game, and as shown by the many combinations of recipes, having a variety of ingredients is very useful. But if you’re hunting for a specific Pokémon or Shiny hunting, you may need an abundance of certain ingredients. To help with this, each location on the world map has weighted drops for the 4 different colours of ingredients. So make sure you take a look at the wheel, and which colour is the most filled in to determine the ingredients you’re going to get the most of. I’ll have a blog post soon detailing the best locations to farm these ingredients, so keep an eye out!

### 3. Use the highest tier cooking pot available

If you want to obtain the strongest Pokémon for your team, cook dishes using the highest tier cooking pot that you have access to. You may think that you can just use a lower tier cooking pot, level up those Pokémon manually, and they’ll be just as strong as getting them from a higher tier pot, meaning you’ve used fewer ingredients overall. However, Attack and Health base stats are higher based on the cooking pot tier you selected to attract that Pokémon. So a Pokémon attracted with a normal pot at level 100 will have worse Attack and Health stats than a Pokémon attracted with a gold pot at level 100. There are some exceptions where you might not use the highest available, like Shiny Hunting or when you have power stones over 900 as base stats won’t make too much of a difference.

### 4. Quickly check Pokémon base stats and stone slots from the edit team menu

A quick and useful tip when you’re in the edit team menu, and a not well-known one, is to tap and hold on a Pokémon, which will bring up their stats quickly so you don’t have to wait on a very slow and boring loading screen. This is incredibly useful if you’re attracting a lot of Pokémon, and need to quickly compare base stats and power stones between Pokémon.

### 5. Be sparing and efficient with your PM tickets

PM tickets, also known as Poké Mart Tickets, are used to purchase decorations, box expansions and various other free to play quirks like speeding up dish cooking. Starting off you should focus on the various decorations available, as they are the most advantageous for making your playthrough easier. You should almost always never use them for skipping expedition wait time for cooking, as you can replenish your expedition limit for just 25 Poké Mart Tickets and run some easy expeditions on auto unless you have an abundance of tickets if you’ve paid for the DLC packs. Look out for another blog post coming out soon talking about the best order to purchase decorations!

### 6. Always have dishes cooking

This might be a no-brainer for some of you, but it took me some time getting used to doing it. As the game works on a timer system, and dishes need expeditions to cook, you should always have a nice and tasty meal cooking, whether that be collecting Pokémon to fill out your Pokédex, or using a basic pot to hunt for Shiny Pokémon.

### 7. Sharing stones paired with stat increasing moves are an expedition must

Sharing stones are great when paired with stat-boosting moves, as they will apply to the rest of your Pokémon team within a certain range. Also, due to the mechanics of the game, if you spam stat-boosting moves the effect can actually stack if the boosts overlap, hence why you might see a lot of people recommending certain bingos for Pokémon like reduced move wait time. Bulk up is a really strong move to use with sharing stones and helps tremendously in late-game expeditions, we highly recommend using Machop with Bulk up as they can have bingos which give them a big move cooldown boost.
